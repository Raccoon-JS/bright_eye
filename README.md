# Bright Eye

A Cyberpunk parody game with trashy aesthetic. Made with [Godot 3.1.1. game engine](https://godotengine.org/).

## Project Origin
It was originally an entry for ["So Bad It's Good" Jam 2018 on itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/sbigjam2018). But I cancelled it before the jam was over.

The Optional Theme at that time was "Cyberpunk".

I brainstormed what kind of game I could make out of that theme. I thought about making Super Mario-style platformer game, or a Rage-inducing game, etc..

For further ideas, I went to Reddit to see what subreddits were treanding on July 30th 2018, 9:55 AM Central Time.

I looked up the cyberpunk color palette that's appropriate for the game, and found the website that would translate English to "Dolan speak", so that would add the sucky nature to it.

## Plot
![The Toms](https://github.com/Raccoon-JS/bright_eyes/blob/master/images/panel2.png)

So there I came up with the story about four villainous black cats (Tom, Thom, Tommy, Thomas) testing an eyeball of the android named Gi-gae (기게 - "machine" in Korean). It's for raising a large sum of money for fishing on a deep dark water. They heard that Gigae's left eye cost a fortune, so they try to steal the eyeball but it ppos out of Gi-gae's eyesock and run off quickly.

All the eyeball needs is an electricity and some safety from the Toms.

## Why did I revive it?
I thought about the project I could work on in a long-term, and I realized how much this game has potentials and I could at least rework on this one. This would also give me an opportunity to develop my game development skills. And it feels nice to look back and improve the one you felt hopeless to complete.
